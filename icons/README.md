# Extension Icons

Chrome requires PNG icons. You need to create these files:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Quick Option: Use a Placeholder

For testing, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images.

## Design Suggestion

A clock icon with Bluesky's blue color (#0085ff) works well.

You can use online tools like:

- https://www.canva.com

Or convert the SVG in this folder using:
