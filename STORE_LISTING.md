Temporary block and mute for Bluesky - auto-expires after your chosen duration. Take a break without permanent consequences.

## Detailed Description

Ever wish you could take a break from someone on Bluesky without making it permanent? ErgoBlock adds temporary block and mute options that automatically expire after your chosen duration.

**HOW IT WORKS**

When you temp block or mute someone:
1. ErgoBlock creates a normal block/mute via Bluesky's API
2. The expiration time is saved securely in your browser
3. When time's up, the block/mute is automatically removed

No more forgetting to unblock people. No more permanent actions when you just need some space.

**FEATURES**

• Temp Block - Block a user temporarily, auto-unblock when time expires
• Temp Mute - Mute a user temporarily, auto-unmute when time expires
• Flexible durations - 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, or 1 week
• Works everywhere - Available in profile menus and post dropdown menus
• Syncs across devices - Your temp blocks/mutes sync via Chrome
• Status popup - See all active temp blocks/mutes and time remaining
• Desktop notifications - Get notified when blocks/mutes expire (optional)

**DURATION OPTIONS**

• 1 hour - Quick cooldown
• 6 hours - Take most of the day off
• 12 hours - Half-day break
• 24 hours - Full day timeout
• 3 days - Weekend break
• 1 week - Extended break

**PRIVACY FOCUSED**

• Open source - review the code yourself
• Only communicates with Bluesky's official API
• No analytics, no tracking, no ads
