Smarter moderation for Bluesky - temporary blocks/mutes that auto-expire, plus tools to review and manage your block list.

## Detailed Description

Take control of your Bluesky moderation with ErgoBlock. Set temporary blocks and mutes that automatically expire, review old decisions with Amnesty mode, and clean up your block list with powerful management tools.

**TEMPORARY BLOCKS & MUTES**

Block or mute someone temporarily - when time's up, it's automatically removed. No more forgetting to unblock people.

• Choose from 1 hour to 1 week durations
• Works from post menus and profile pages
• Desktop notifications when blocks expire
• Syncs across devices via browser sync

**AMNESTY MODE - Review Past Decisions**

Revisit your blocks and mutes one at a time:
• See why you blocked them (interaction context)
• View mutual connections and relationships
• Keep, remove, or skip with one click
• Track your review progress over time

**MASS OPERATIONS - Clean Up Block Lists**

Scan your account for mass-block patterns:
• Find blocks clustered by shared follows
• Bulk unblock/unmute with one click
• Great for cleaning up old mass-block actions

**COPY USER - Bootstrap Your Moderation**

Look up any Bluesky user and selectively copy their blocks or follows to your account. Useful for getting started with moderation based on people you trust.

**LIST AUDIT - Review Moderation Lists**

Review members of your moderation lists using the same Amnesty workflow. Keep your lists curated and up to date.

**MANAGER DASHBOARD**

Full-featured management interface:
• View all blocks, mutes, and managed lists
• Search and filter by handle or context
• See interaction history and relationship info
• Expandable rows for detailed context

**PRIVACY FOCUSED**

• All data stays in your browser
• No external servers, no tracking, no ads
• Open source - review the code yourself
• Only communicates with Bluesky's official API
